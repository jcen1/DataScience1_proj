Let's work on this together

## Desciption
**Topic:** Energy consumption in London city. <br>
**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london <br>
**Approach/Question:** By using this dataset, we will explore the drive of energy consumption. Specifically, we believe that weather conditions have a strong correlation with energy consumption w.r.t population's different demographics. Our project will use ML model to prove that assumption and predict household energy consumption.
